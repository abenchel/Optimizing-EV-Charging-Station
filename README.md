# 🚀 Optimizing EV Charging Station Placement using K-Medians & Interactive Visualization

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on **optimizing the placement of electric vehicle (EV) charging stations** using the **K-Medians clustering algorithm**. By leveraging **spatial data analysis** and **interactive visualization**, we aim to strategically position charging stations to **enhance accessibility, efficiency, and demand coverage**.

## 🏆 Key Features

- 📊 **Data Collection & Preprocessing** – Aggregating geospatial, traffic, and demographic data.
- 📌 **K-Medians Clustering** – Identifying optimal charging station locations based on real-world data.
- 🗺️ **Interactive Visualization** – Using Folium and Plotly for mapping and analytics.
- ⚡ **Scalable & Robust Model** – Designed for urban planning and mobility optimization.

## 🛠️ Technologies & Libraries

This project is implemented using:

- **Python**
- **Scikit-learn** – K-Medians clustering
- **Pandas & NumPy** – Data processing
- **Folium & Plotly** – Interactive visualization
- **Geopandas** – Spatial data handling

## 📈 Methodology

### 1️⃣ Data Collection & Cleaning
   - Gathered geospatial data (EV stations, road networks, population density).  
   - Cleaned and normalized datasets for consistency.

### 2️⃣ K-Medians Clustering
   - Applied K-Medians instead of K-Means for **outlier-resistant clustering**.  
   - Used Manhattan distance for more **realistic urban mobility modeling**.

### 3️⃣ Visualization & Evaluation
   - Plotted station locations using **Folium interactive maps**.  
   - Evaluated results based on coverage, accessibility, and cost-efficiency.
